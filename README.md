## Criteria for MyDRTV
Must have a high availability and provide access to the major collection of old TV programmes and movies at a global scale. These should be easy to search for with the ability to search for year of production, title, genre etc.
This is part of a digital transformation project and  therefore all aspects of the business cycle, including marketing of DR's services to customers, like interactivity with users through a rating system and a "if you liked this, you'll like this show/movie" feature to encourage users to stay on the app for a longer period of time.
